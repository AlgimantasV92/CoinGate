There are several steps I would take to test the login and sign up inputs in Jira:

1. First, I would review the requirements and any relevant documentation to ensure I have a clear understanding of what needs to be tested.

2. Next, I would create a test plan outlining the specific tests I will be performing on the login and sign up inputs. 
This might include tests for valid and invalid input, as well as tests for different user roles and permissions.

3. Then, I would set up a test environment with the appropriate information in Jira and any necessary test data.

4. Once the test environment is set up, I would begin executing the tests outlined in my test plan, making sure to document any issues or bugs that I encounter.

5. After all of the tests have been completed, I would compile my results and create a report detailing my findings. 
If any issues were discovered, I would include notes about it.
